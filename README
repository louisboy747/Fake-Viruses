Hello! Welcome to the slightly damaging branch!
--------------------------------------------------------
These viruses have more power than the fake viruses, if your looking for something more hardcore.
Most of these will just open a bunch of windows in your browser, play music, and maybe even shutdown! ;)
Only run these if YOU KNOW what your doing, or just run them in a VM, to be safe.
Run these on a high end PC, as they will cause lag. If you ran these on a low-mid end PC, it will cause a lot of OS lag, or even crash the OS.
Again, these probably won't ruin your PC. The most they'll do is cause loads of lag, but they won't damage your PC badly, as long as your on a high end one.
