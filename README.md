# Fake-Viruses
A few joke viruses to freak out your friends!
------------------------------------------------------
DISLAIMERS
------------------------------------------------------
1. These files WILL NOT damage your computer, they are just prank viruses.
2. Some of these fake viruses will not let you close them with the 'X'. Instead, use task manager or restart your PC.
3. Nearly all these 'viruses' are windows campatible only. This is because they use the 'Microsoft Screening' tool to make them work. However, I will try and make some for Linux distributions. Dont worry, there will be branches.
4. Some of these fake viruses are supposed to replicate app installers such as Google Chrome, just so your aware.
5. If I was to add compatibility for other operating systems in the future, there will be change logs at the bottom of this read me.

That is all! I hope you stick around in my repo to see what 'viruses' I can come up with soon! :D
